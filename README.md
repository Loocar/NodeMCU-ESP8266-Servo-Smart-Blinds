## Modding the Servo for Continuous Rotation

The MG995 Servo can only rotate 180°. This [video](https://youtu.be/8bcYB-0bctE?t=1m14s) is a guide to mod the servo for continuous 360° rotation. At [1m 59s](https://youtu.be/8bcYB-0bctE?t=1m59s), he used a pair of needle nose pliers to remove the stop pin from the gear, but that did not work for me. I had to use a dremel to cut it off.

## Setting up NodeMCU with Arduino IDE

I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEo1WsT5T7s) to get started uploading code to the NodeMCU. I'm using a mac so I used these [drivers](https://github.com/MPParsley/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver).

## Uploading code to the NodeMCU
Coming soon...
